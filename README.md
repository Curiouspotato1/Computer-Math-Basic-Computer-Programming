# Computer-Math-Basic-Computer-Programming
Projects that were made during the Basic Computer Programming Class, All works were written by me and sometimes with lots and Lots Of Struggle


Year 1... 
This involves all things that involved ChIDE and the wonderful program that it is
Additionally All UC Davis Mock Challanges (Years 2016 and 2017)
If you would like to copy any and all of the code you may do so as you wish.
As all examples do contain comment codes that explain how each program works.
Look for these (// and /*, as these are the comment codes. They will also appear green in the code window)
Other that, that is pretty much it.
If you like I did the same thing for the Arduino Robots (Parallax set) and can be found in my profile!
However for those I put no comment codes on any of those programs (Lazy Slob)
So if you wonder how anything works... Good Luck on those!

Thank you for taking the time to read me and I hope you enjoy the code that is presented hear.
