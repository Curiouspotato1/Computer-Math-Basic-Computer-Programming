 *It is in this step that the program will find out where the bot must go to reach the hacky sack
 *For example:
 *If you put that the hacky sack is located at one, the bot will travel to the point one.
 *There is one input for each of the six locations that the hacky sack is located
 *The code ball.driveDistance(x, y) is used to tell the bot what angle to move at(x) and for how long(y) */
